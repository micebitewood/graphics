keylistener.java

   This is an example of using Java's newer
   listener model for getting user's key
   events.  While more complicated, it has
   the advantage of being able to capture
   key events before the first mouse click
   onto the applet.

   To run from the command line, type:

      appletviewer keylistener.html

listener.java

   This example shows how to use Java's newer
   listener model both for key events and for
   mouse events.

   To run from the command line, type:

      appletviewer listener.html

octave.java
Instrument.java
MidiSynth.java

   This shows how to use java's Midi synthesizer
   package.  MidiSynth.java is my low level
   wrapper around java's package.  Instrument.java
   is my easy-to-use higher level wrapper on top
   of MidiSynth.java.  octave.java is my example
   of using Instrument.java to make a simple
   graphical musical keyboard.
